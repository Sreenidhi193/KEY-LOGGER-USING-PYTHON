# KEY-LOGGER-USING-PYTHON


---

Greetings,

A keylogger, or keystroke logger, is a type of software or hardware designed to record and monitor the keystrokes made on a computer's keyboard. It collects this information and can transmit it to a remote location, typically controlled by a malicious actor using a command-and-control (C&C) server. In simpler terms, a keylogger is a program that covertly tracks all keyboard inputs, potentially exposing sensitive information like passwords. Unauthorized access and privacy invasion through keyloggers are criminal offenses under both state and federal laws in the United States.

The project we are discussing aims to explore the field of cybersecurity by demonstrating how unauthorized access to a system can occur through the use of a keylogger. The project includes a Python script called "keylogger_final.py," which, when executed from the command prompt, prompts the user to enter their email and password. Once this information is provided, the keylogger captures and sends the keystrokes made by the targeted individual to the specified email address at regular intervals, as specified in the code.

It is crucial to emphasize that this project is intended for educational purposes only. Engaging in any form of unauthorized access or using keyloggers without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Privacy violations and unauthorized access to someone else's computer are serious offenses that may result in legal consequences.

If you are interested in pursuing a career in cybersecurity or learning more about ethical hacking, there are legitimate and responsible paths to follow. You can consider formal education, ethical hacking certifications, or participating in legal penetration testing, always with proper authorization and adherence to ethical guidelines. Responsible and ethical use of cybersecurity knowledge is essential to ensure the security and privacy of individuals and organizations.

If you have any questions or need guidance on ethical cybersecurity practices or educational resources in this field, please feel free to ask.

Thank you.
